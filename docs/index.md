# Team Docs

This documentation tool is created so that the co-operation can be more efficient, and the knowledge can be preserved and re-used.    
We can keep track of all our works here in a centralized place, and link contents to different places such as team drive, google docs etc.      
Can be deployed on our own server and managed through git. 

## Basics
* MarkDown is used to edit the pages.
* To facilitate the colaboration on coding, the overall frameworks and a set of interfaces should be defined on the initiation.
* Each part in one project page should be kept as reusable as possible to be referrable in other projects.


## Writing and publishing on our github pages doc
Here is a brief guide to building the documentation tool from github, writing and publishing on the github pages

### Synchronize source code from remote repo

#### Cloning to local
1. Cloning the source code repo from [our github repo](https://github.com/diceaiteam/teamdocs) using git;
2. In the local cloned project, edit the pages;
3. Preview content in local server using `mkdocs serve`

#### Commit Locally
1. `git add ` to add the changes to git
2. `git commit` to commit to the local git 

#### Commit remotely
1. Make sure local git has access to remote repo (an easy way would be to add collaborator);
2. Use `git push origin main` to push to origin's main branch.

### build the site and publish
1. Use `mkdocs build` to build the documentation. The output dir can be specified with -d option;
2. Make sure the built dir is in gh-pages branch which is the default branch of publishing page;
3. Connect the build site with [remote repo](https://github.com/diceaiteam/diceaiteam.github.io) if not already done;
4. Commit locally first and then push with overwrite: `git push -f origin gh-pages`;
5. Check [Actions](https://github.com/diceaiteam/diceaiteam.github.io/actions) of the github project and make sure the deployment is successful.
